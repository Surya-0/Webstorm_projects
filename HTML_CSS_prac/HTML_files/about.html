    <u><h1 class = "header">About the Amur tiger</h1></u>
    <p class="desc"> Amur-tigers are one of the larger tiger subspecies.  The average weight for males is 220-250 kg, while females are smaller, at 160-190 kg.
        Males, females and cubs can be distinguished by their tracks: a male’s paw pad measures 10.5 – 14.5 cm across, a female’s 8.5 – 9.5. cm, and a cub’s – from 5.5 – 10 cm.
        (Male cubs, after one year, usually have paw measurements already larger than their mothers’).
        Amur tiger coat colour is a lighter orange than other tiger subspecies and becomes even more so in winter.
        Their coat is longer and thicker than other sub-populations because of the colder climate and they have a thick mane around the neck and extra fur on their paws, which protects them against the cold.

    <p class ="breed">
        Sexual maturity is reached around 4 years, but varies with gender and is earlier in zoo tigers.
        When a female is ready to mate she will signal by leaving scratch marks and urine deposits to attract males.
        Gestation last 3 to 3 1/2 months, litter size is 1-6, however, 2-4 is the most common.
